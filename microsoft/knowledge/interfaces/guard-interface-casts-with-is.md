# Guard optional interface casts with `is`

## Description

From runtime 15.0, AL can type-test an interface or `Variant` with `is` and cast it to another interface with `as`. The test is non-throwing, but `as` raises a runtime error when the underlying codeunit does not implement the target interface. This matters when an extended capability is optional or implementations can come from other extensions.

## Best Practice

Use `is` to establish that the value supports the target interface before using `as`. Cast directly only where the target implementation is an invariant guaranteed by the surrounding contract.

See sample: [`guard-interface-casts-with-is.good.al`](guard-interface-casts-with-is.good.al).

## Anti Pattern

Using `as` unconditionally for an optional extended interface. An otherwise valid implementation of the base interface then fails at runtime merely because it does not implement the additional contract.

See sample: [`guard-interface-casts-with-is.bad.al`](guard-interface-casts-with-is.bad.al).
