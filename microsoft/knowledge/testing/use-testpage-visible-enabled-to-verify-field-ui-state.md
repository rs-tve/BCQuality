# Verify field visibility and enabled state with TestPage.Visible()/.Enabled()

## Description

A UI test codeunit does not need to inspect table or page properties indirectly to confirm a field is shown or enabled under given conditions. The `TestPage` object exposes a `Visible()` and an `Enabled()` function on each field, reflecting the page's actual rendered state, callable directly from a `[Test]` procedure. `Enabled()` and `Editable()` are distinct states — this article covers visibility/enabled state specifically; see `use-testpage-editable-to-verify-field-editability.md` for verifying whether a field can actually be changed.

## Best Practice

Open the `TestPage`, navigate to the relevant record if needed, then assert against `TestPageField.Visible()` and `TestPageField.Enabled()` to verify the field's shown/enabled state, rather than checking an unrelated table/page property or skipping the check.

See sample: [`use-testpage-visible-enabled-to-verify-field-ui-state.good.al`](use-testpage-visible-enabled-to-verify-field-ui-state.good.al).

## Anti Pattern

A test that opens the `TestPage` but never asserts against `Visible()`/`Enabled()` on the field in question — confirming only that the page opens, not that the field behaves as expected.

See sample: [`use-testpage-visible-enabled-to-verify-field-ui-state.bad.al`](use-testpage-visible-enabled-to-verify-field-ui-state.bad.al).
