# Tag test codeunits with FEATURE, SCENARIO, GIVEN, WHEN, and THEN comments

## Description

Test codeunits are easier to trust and to review when they carry a four-level comment structure taken from Behaviour-/Acceptance-Test-Driven Development: `[FEATURE]` once at the top of the codeunit naming the functional area under test, `[SCENARIO]` above each test procedure stating one falsifiable business claim in plain language, and `[GIVEN]`/`[WHEN]`/`[THEN]` marking the precondition, action, and assertion inside the test body. Without these tags a test procedure is an opaque block of AL that only reveals its intent by being read line by line; a reviewer or product owner cannot scan a codeunit and know what business behaviour it covers.

## Best Practice

Put `[FEATURE]` as a comment before the codeunit's opening brace, naming the domain rather than the object — Microsoft's own guidance allows setting it once for the whole codeunit, inherited by every test in it. Put `[SCENARIO]`, matching the current BCApps corpus, as the first comment inside each test procedure's body (after `begin`), describing the scenario in business language that complements — not duplicates — the procedure name, followed by `[GIVEN]` marking the precondition setup, `[WHEN]` marking the single action under test, and `[THEN]` marking the assertions. The procedure name stays the machine-readable identity shown in test-runner output; the `[SCENARIO]` comment stays the human-readable one. Neither replaces the other.

See sample: [`test-feature-scenario-tags.good.al`](test-feature-scenario-tags.good.al).

## Anti Pattern

A test procedure with no `[FEATURE]`/`[SCENARIO]`/`[GIVEN]`/`[WHEN]`/`[THEN]` structure, setup mixed freely with assertions, and a procedure name like `Test1` that says nothing about what is being verified. Nothing in the codeunit tells a reader what business rule it exists to protect.

See sample: [`test-feature-scenario-tags.bad.al`](test-feature-scenario-tags.bad.al).
