# Apply and unapply entries through the application workflow, not status flags

## Description

Customer/vendor settlement is a posting operation involving detailed ledger entries, not just a change to `Open` on the main entry. Remaining amounts are calculated from detailed entries. Unapplication posts correcting entries and handles application-derived effects such as discounts and currency gains/losses; deleting details or changing `Unapplied` cannot reproduce that history.

## Best Practice

Use `"CustEntry-Apply Posted Entries"` / `"VendEntry-Apply Posted Entries"` and the supported application or unapplication workflow. Let it check application dates, entry state, and application ordering. The `ApplyCustEntryFormEntry` / `ApplyVendEntryFormEntry` and `UnApply...LedgEntry` methods are **interactive**: users select and confirm the operation. They are not unattended "mark paid" APIs.

For programmatic posting, use the target version's public `Apply` / `PostUnApply...` APIs with properly prepared selection and `Apply Unapply Parameters`; handle cancellation and the workflow's transaction/commit behavior. `"Applying Entry"`, `"Applies-to ID"`, and `"Amount to Apply"` are legitimate application-preparation fields. Do not report their writes alone, temporary buffers, supported posting/compression internals, or unrelated operational/extension fields.

See sample: [`apply-ledger-entries-through-application-codeunits.good.al`](apply-ledger-entries-through-application-codeunits.good.al).

## Anti Pattern

Implement customer/vendor payment matching, settlement, or reopening by directly persisting `Open`, `"Closed by Entry No."`, closure amounts/dates, or detailed-entry unapplication flags, or by deleting/rewriting detailed application amounts. Require confirmed writes to existing non-temporary customer/vendor or detailed customer/vendor entries and settlement intent. Item/inventory application records belong to SCM, not this rule. Do not suggest assigning a `Remaining Amount` FlowField as a fix.

This article owns fabricated application state. Use the [posted-financial-content rule](do-not-modify-or-delete-posted-ledger-entries.md) for original accounting-value corrections, not a second finding prescribing the same application fix.

See sample: [`apply-ledger-entries-through-application-codeunits.bad.al`](apply-ledger-entries-through-application-codeunits.bad.al).
